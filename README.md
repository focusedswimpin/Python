# CLI To-Do App

Welcome to the CLI To-Do App! This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) based to-do list application that allows you to manage your tasks efficiently through a terminal or command prompt. This project is implemented in Python and uses a plain text file to store your to-dos.

## Features

- **Add To-Do**: Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Show To-Do List**: Display all your current tasks with their indices.
- **Edit To-Do**: Modify an existing task by its index.
- **Complete To-Do**: Mark a task as completed and remove it from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in a text file (`todos.txt`) ensuring your to-dos persist between sessions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cli-todo-app.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    ```sh
    cd cli-todo-app
    ```

### Usage

Run the `todo.py` script using Python:

```sh
python todo.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a command:
- `add`: Add a new to-do item.
- `show`: Display all to-do items.
- `edit`: Edit an existing to-do item.
- `complete`: Mark a to-do item as complete and remove it.
- `exit`: Exit the application.

Example usage:

1. **Adding a To-Do**
    ```sh
    Type add, show, edit, complete, or exit: add
    Enter a todo: Buy groceries
    ```

2. **Showing To-Dos**
    ```sh
    Type add, show, edit, complete, or exit: show
    1. Buy groceries
    ```

3. **Editing a To-Do**
    ```sh
    Type add, show, edit, complete, or exit: edit
    Enter the number of the to-do to edit: 1
    Enter a new todo: Buy fresh groceries
    ```

4. **Completing a To-Do**
    ```sh
    Type add, show, edit, complete, or exit: complete
    Enter the number of the to-do to complete: 1
    Removed: Buy fresh groceries
    ```

### Notes

- Ensure that you have read/write permissions in the directory where you run the script, as it creates and modifies the `todos.txt` file.
- This application is designed to be simple and straightforward, suitable for small to-do lists. For more advanced features, consider looking into more complex to-do list applications.
